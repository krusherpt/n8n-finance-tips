## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Explained

The workflow is triggered by a schedule and performs the following steps:

1.  **Fetch RSS Feeds**: It starts by pulling data from a wide range of financial RSS feeds. These are grouped into the following categories:
    * Forex (e.g., Action Forex)
    * Cryptocurrency (e.g., Cointelegraph, Bitcoinist)
    * General Economy (e.g., NY Times, FT, Dow Jones)
    * Commodities (e.g., Oil & Gas 360, BullionStar)

2.  **Filter Recent News**: For each category, a **Filter** node sifts through the articles to only include those published within the last week.

3.  **Process and Summarize**:
    * A **Code** node extracts the title and content from each article.
    * A **LangChain Agent** powered by **Google Gemini** receives the processed text. Each agent has a specific personality (e.g., "forex finance analyst," "crypto finance analyst") and generates a summary and investment advice based on its category.

4.  **Merge and Final Report**:
    * The summaries from all categories are merged.
    * A final **LangChain Agent** creates a comprehensive, well-structured report from all the individual summaries.

5.  **Deliver to Discord**:
    * The final report is split into chunks to adhere to Discord's message length limits.
    * The workflow posts the report to a designated Discord channel.
    * Before sending the new report, it clears the previous messages in the channel to keep it clean.
